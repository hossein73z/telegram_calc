This code provides a Telegram chatbot application that allows users to calculate the result of mathematical expressions. The application is powered by the telegram and logging Python modules. It handles two commands: /start to greet the user and message to calculate the result of a mathematical expression. The code uses basic configuration for logging and allows the user to enter any expression containing only numbers and math operators. If anything else is entered, an error message is shown.
